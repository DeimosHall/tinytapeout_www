> Hi, I'm a professor for an Introduction to Digital Systems course and just found this and let's just say this has **fundamentally just changed our entire Computer Engineering curriculum**. It looks like we can actually have first-year students designing ASICs, then be able later to analyze performance while taking their electronics course and learning about MOSFETs as well as their embedded systems and computer architecture.

# Testimonials

An educational chip development workflow entirely in-browser, 
from graphic entry to GDSII output for #sky130! Stunning work by 
@matthewvenn to make an opaque area of technology accessible.

---
Last week I designed an integrated circuit for #tinytapeout, my first digital circuit design not to include any kind of cpu.

---
I still can't get over how smooth the ASIC design workflow of the #tinytapeout is 

---
Thank you @matthewvenn and everyone who made #tinytapeout happen! I made a simple counter FSM based on a UTexas presentation (linked below), but I made it all on my new Steamdeck!

---
Created a 128-Bit Memory (8 x 16-Bit Blocks) custom ASIC. I hope it will be manufactured in next shuttle run.
Aside from that, It was amazing how seamless and easy was the whole process.

---

I want to change my VLSI class in the spring (April-June) to utilise your tiny chip infrastructure. If I could say every student in my class got something made, that would be awesome.

---
Built a CRC logic for the http://tinytapeout.com of @matthewvenn with my son. Looking forward if the tapeout happens ðŸ¥° Yet either way, the workflow is astonishing. CI/CD for chip design ðŸ¤¯

---
Thank you for doing it - I always wanted to join these OpenMPW shuttles, but never felt ready for it. TinyTapeout provided a way for me to get in, while only spending 1 evening of effort on my end. That's amazing! 

---
Just made a 4-bit barrel shifter by using this http://tinytapeout.com toolkit. It's quick and fun to use. The GDS even generated within minutes. Everyone should try this.
